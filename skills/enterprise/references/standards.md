# Enterprise Engineering Standards

This is the single source of truth for coding standards enforced across all enterprise pipeline stages. Every enterprise skill references this file instead of repeating these rules inline.

---

> **Stack Resolution**: Values like `tenant_id` and `authenticateStaff` referenced below are defaults.
> Read actual values from `.claude/enterprise-state/stack-profile.json`:
> - Tenant field: `multi_tenancy.field` (default: `tenant_id`)
> - Auth middleware: `auth.middleware_name` (default: `authenticateStaff`)
> - Source directory: `structure.source_dirs.backend`
> If multi-tenancy is disabled (`multi_tenancy.enabled: false`), skip all tenant isolation checks.

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

Every database operation must scope to the authenticated tenant. This exists because the application serves multiple businesses from one database — a missing `tenant_id` (or configured tenant field from stack profile) filter means one customer sees another's data.

### Writes
- Every `INSERT` statement includes the tenant field (`tenant_id` or as configured in stack profile) sourced from `the authenticated user's tenant identifier` (never from user input)
- Every `UPDATE` and `DELETE` includes `WHERE tenant_id = $N` in addition to the record ID

### Reads
- Every `SELECT` includes `WHERE tenant_id = $N` (or joins through a tenant-scoped table)
- Aggregate queries (`COUNT`, `SUM`, etc.) must also scope to tenant

### Verification
```bash
# Grep for SQL statements missing $TENANT_FIELD in changed files
git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD | xargs grep -n -E '(INSERT INTO|UPDATE .* SET|DELETE FROM|SELECT .* FROM)' | grep -v $TENANT_FIELD | grep -v __tests__
```

## SQL Safety

### Parameterized Queries Only
All query values use positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) — zero string concatenation or template literals in SQL strings. This prevents SQL injection, which is the #1 web application vulnerability.

```
// Correct — parameterized (syntax varies by framework)
// Node/pg:   pool.query('SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = $1 AND tenant = $2', [id, tenantId])
// Python:    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = %s AND tenant = %s', (id, tenant_id))
// Ruby/AR:   Item.where(id: id, tenant_id: tenant_id)
// Go:        db.Query("SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = $1 AND tenant = $2", id, tenantId)

// Wrong — SQL injection risk (any framework)
// query(`SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = ${id}`)
```

### Timestamp Type
All timestamp columns use `TIMESTAMPTZ` (not `TIMESTAMP`). Without timezone awareness, timestamps shift when servers are in different timezones, causing data corruption in date-based queries.

### Migration Guards
All `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE INDEX` statements use `IF NOT EXISTS`. This makes migrations idempotent — safe to run multiple times without error.

## File Size Limits

Source files (excluding tests) have size limits to maintain readability and prevent "god files" that become impossible to navigate:

| Limit | Lines | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Soft limit** | 400 | New code should not push a file past this. If approaching, extract a module. |
| **Hard limit** | 800 | File must not exceed this. If already over, refactor when touched — don't grow further. |

Test files are exempt from these limits.

---

## Authentication & Route Order

### Middleware
- Every new route that handles tenant data requires `authenticateStaff` (or configured auth middleware from stack profile) middleware (or an explicitly documented justification for being public)
- Public routes (webhooks, health checks) must mount BEFORE the `authenticateStaff` (or configured auth middleware from stack profile) middleware in the route registration order — otherwise they'll be blocked

### Route Pattern
```
// Public routes first (webhooks, health checks)
// Register these BEFORE auth middleware

// Then auth middleware ($AUTH_MIDDLEWARE)
// Apply to all subsequent routes

// Then protected routes
// All routes after this point require authentication
```

## Debug Artifact Rules

No debug code ships to production. These artifacts indicate incomplete work and can leak internal state to users.

### Banned in Production Files
- `console.log()` — use structured logging instead
- `console.debug()`
- `debugger` statements
- `// TODO` / `// FIXME` / `// HACK` / `// XXX` comments

### Allowed Exceptions
- `console.error()` in error handlers — this is legitimate error logging
- `console.warn()` in deprecation notices
- Any of the above in test files (`.test.js`, `.spec.js`, `__tests__/`)

### Verification
```bash
# Check for debug artifacts in changed source files (not test files)
git diff -- '*.js' '*.jsx' | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++' | grep -v '\.test\.' | grep -iE 'console\.(log|debug|warn|info)|debugger|TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX' | grep -v 'console\.error'
```

---

## Error Handling

### No Silent Failures
Every `catch` block must either:
1. Log the error with context (what operation, what inputs, what tenant)
2. Re-throw the error
3. Return an explicit error response

Empty catch blocks are bugs — they hide real failures that then manifest as mysterious data corruption.

### User-Facing Error Messages
- Generic messages only — no stack traces, internal file paths, or SQL errors exposed to users
- Use structured error responses: `{ error: 'Human-readable message' }`
- Log the full error internally (with stack trace) for debugging

### Error Response Pattern
```javascript
try {
  const result = await someOperation();
  res.json(result);
} catch (err) {
  logger.error('Failed to [operation]', { tenantId, input, error: err.message, stack: err.stack });
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'An internal error occurred' });
}
```

## Standard Invariants (INV-1 through INV-7)

These invariants apply to every enterprise contract. They represent the baseline quality bar — violations are always bugs.

| ID | Invariant | Why It Matters |
|----|-----------|---------------|
| INV-1 | Every INSERT includes $TENANT_FIELD | Multi-tenant data isolation |
| INV-2 | Every SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE scopes to $TENANT_FIELD | Prevents cross-tenant data leaks |
| INV-3 | All SQL uses parameterized values (`$1`, `$2`) — zero concatenation | SQL injection prevention |
| INV-4 | No source file exceeds 400 lines (soft) / 800 lines (hard) | Code maintainability |
| INV-5 | Every new route has `authenticateStaff` (`$AUTH_MIDDLEWARE`) (or explicit public justification) | Authorization enforcement |
| INV-6 | Every user-facing error is generic (no stack traces, no internal paths) | Security — information disclosure prevention |
| INV-7 | All timestamps use `TIMESTAMPTZ` (not `TIMESTAMP`) | Timezone correctness |

### Applying Invariants to Contracts
When writing a contract, include all 7 invariants. If one doesn't apply to the current task, mark it `N/A` with a brief justification (e.g., "INV-7: N/A — no new timestamp columns").

## Type Traps

Type traps are project-specific inconsistencies discovered by `/enterprise-discover` and stored in `stack-traps.json`. Common examples include:
- Column type mismatches across tables (e.g., UUID vs integer foreign keys)
- Inconsistent naming conventions between modules
- Legacy schema patterns that break modern assumptions

See `stack-traps.json` for your project's specific traps. When joining tables with mismatched types, always cast to a common type.
